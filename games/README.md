# Vext Games Directory

This directory is intended to house the source code forgames that are integrated or strictly coupled with the Vext platform for development purposes.

- **Standalone Games**: Can be developed here or in their own repositories.
- **Prototypes**: Use this folder for quick prototyping (like the cancelled Bevy prototype).
